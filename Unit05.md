**Unit 5: Continued Fractions** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this, the second of our “sightseeing” units, we visit* **continued
fractions**.*Continued fractionsare a surprisingly ancient topic that
consists of writing numbers as fractions within fractions and*
not*simplifying them! Continued fractions enjoy several properties that
allow us to find concise representations of both rational numbers and
even of many irrational numbers.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   write numbers in continued fraction representation; and
-   identify certain classes of numbers from their representation as
    continued fractions.
