A course in elementary number theory concerns itself primarily with
simple, arithmetical manipulations of counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, and so
forth. These numbers hold a great deal more secrets than one might
imagine at first. Despite their apparent simplicity, some of the
hardest, most difficult problems in mathematics arise from the study of
the theory of numbers. Grade-schoolers can comprehend questions whose
solutions evade centuries of investigation. Entirely new fields of
mathematical study have grown from research into these questions made
possible by number theory. One of the fundamental objects of study
involves the prime numbers. Nearly every integer can be built by
multiplying prime numbers, which means that we can solve a large number
of problems simply by thinking about them in terms of prime numbers.
Even when a number n is not prime, we can restrict our arithmetic to a
set of numbers relatively prime to n and recover many properties of a
prime number. A signal for this is related to another important tool of
number theory, the greatest common divisor (gcd). The gcd allows us to
solve linear Diophantine equations, which look like the linear equations
you studied in precalculus, but restrict their solutions to integer
values. Related to the study of linear Diophantine equations is a
clockwork mathematics called congruence, where you can assert with a
straight face that, for example, 1 + 1 = 0 and not be thrown out of the
room. As the course draws to its finale, we combine prime numbers,
relatively prime numbers, and congruence to explain how a deceptively
simple problem – factoring an integer into two primes – is in fact so
difficult that it can guarantee the security of internet communication,
including the credit card number you type when you make an online
purchase! Along the way, we take a few detours for the sake of
sightseeing. We examine some problems that fascinated the ancient Greek
cult of Pythagoreans – perhaps unto death! This segues nicely into
classes of numbers that are obtained easily from the integers, but have
some unsettling properties. A recurring theme will focus on how these
other classes of numbers preserve the so-called ring properties of the
integers. We look at different ways to represent numbers, including the
technique of continued fractions, which enjoys some surprising
properties. Neither last, nor least, we construct numbers that turn
traditional notions of arithmetic on its head, requiring us to
reconsider even the definition of our beloved primes! Some aspects of
this course will be experimental: we introduce you to a computer algebra
system, Sage, and encourage you to infer patterns and solutions by
experimentation.

### Course Information

**Welcome to Elementary Number Theory.** Below you will find some
general information on the course and its requirements.  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Wissam Raji's [*An Introductory Course in Elementary Number
    Theory*](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/An-Introductory-in-Elementary-Number-Theory.pdf)
-   The Sage Foundation's [*The Sage Notebook*](http://www.sagenb.org/)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total of
**48 hours**. Each unit includes a *time advisory* that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These advisories
should help you plan your time accordingly. It might be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.
