**Unit 4: Numbers that Lack Integrity** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit focuses primarily on objects that solve mathematical
problems, but are neither integers, arithmetic combinations of integers,
nor even algebraic combinations of integers. The first topic we owe to
the Pythagoreans; their well-known theorem of right triangles led them
to a discovery they actually found repugnant: the existence of
so-called* **irrational numbers***.*  
  
 *As you know, some numbers are not merely irrational; they are
imaginary. Our last set of interesting numbers consists of the*
**Gaussian integers***, complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts
are integers. They resemble the integers in many ways – ring properties,
a way to divide with remainder – but they differ in one very important
way: the notion of a prime number. We don't go into much depth on that
here, but merely introduce the problem, then refine it as the course
progresses.*  
  
 *By the 19*<sup>*th*</sup>* century, mathematicians’ attitudes toward
numbers that didn't fit a certain scheme were somewhat more accepting,
so when they encountered numbers that weren't* **algebraic***, they
apparently felt that these numbers in some sense rose above the others,
and called them* **transcendental***. Any spiritual or religious
connotation is purely coincidental.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   define rational numbers, and explain how they satisfy the properties
    of a ring;
-   distinguish between rational and irrational numbers;
-   explain why some specific numbers are irrational, while others are
    algebraic;
-   identify the Gaussian integers, perform arithmetic with them, and
    explain how they satisfy the properties of a ring, yet their notion
    of primality diverges from that of “ordinary” integers;
-   define algebraic numbers, and explain how they satisfy the
    properties of a ring; and
-   distinguish between algebraic and transcendental numbers.
